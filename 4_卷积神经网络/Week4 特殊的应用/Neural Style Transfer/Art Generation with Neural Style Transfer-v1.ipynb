As seen below, it merges two images, namely, a \"content\" image (C) and a \"style\" image (S), to create a \"generated\" image (G). The generated image G combines the \"content\" of the image C with the \"style\" of image S. \n",

    "We would like the \"generated\" image G to have similar content as the input image C. Suppose you have chosen some layer's activations to represent the content of an image. In practice, you'll get the most visually pleasing results if you choose a layer in the middle of the network--neither too shallow nor too deep. (After you have finished this exercise, feel free to come back and experiment with using different layers, to see how the results vary.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, suppose you have picked one particular hidden layer to use. Now, set the image C as the input to the pretrained VGG network, and run forward propagation. Let $a^{(C)}$ be the hidden layer activations in the layer you had chosen. (In lecture, we had written this as $a^{[l](C)}$, but here we'll drop the superscript $[l]$ to simplify the notation.) This will be a $n_H \\times n_W \\times n_C$ tensor. Repeat this process with the image G: Set G as the input, and run forward progation. Let $$a^{(G)}$$ be the corresponding hidden layer activation. We will define as the content cost function as:\n",

    "Here, $n_H, n_W$ and $n_C$ are the height, width and number of channels of the hidden layer you have chosen, and appear in a normalization term in the cost. For clarity, note that $a^{(C)}$ and $a^{(G)}$ are the volumes corresponding to a hidden layer's activations. In order to compute the cost $J_{content}(C,G)$, it might also be convenient to unroll these 3D volumes into a 2D matrix, as shown below. (Technically this unrolling step isn't needed to compute $J_{content}$, but it will be good practice for when you do need to carry out a similar operation later for computing the style const $J_{style}$.)\n",

    "Great job on completing this assignment! You are now able to use Neural Style Transfer to generate artistic images. This is also your first time building a model in which the optimization algorithm updates the pixel values rather than the neural network's parameters. Deep learning has many different types of models and this is only one of them! \n",

    "- Neural Style Transfer is an algorithm that given a content image C and a style image S can generate an artistic image\n",
    "- It uses representations (hidden layer activations) based on a pretrained ConvNet. \n",
    "- The content cost function is computed using one hidden layer's activations.\n",
    "- The style cost function for one layer is computed using the Gram matrix of that layer's activations. The overall style cost function is obtained using several hidden layers.\n",
